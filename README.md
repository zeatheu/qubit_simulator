## Interactive Qubit Visualization and Simulation

This web application provides an interactive 3D visualization of a single qubit using the Bloch sphere representation. One can observe the qubit’s state as a 3D arrow, rotate the sphere in real time, and apply quantum gates (e.g., X, Y, Z, Hadamard, phase gates) to see how the state evolves. The application calculates the qubit state using standard vector-matrix operations, updating the visualization dynamically.
The project is designed to be both educational and interactive, providing a hands-on way to explore fundamental quantum computing concepts, including superposition, gate operations, and the geometric interpretation of qubit states.

#### Key Features:

* 3D Bloch sphere visualization with real-time rotation

* Qubit state represented as a dynamic arrow

* Interactive application of quantum gates

* Smooth animations to illustrate gate operations

This app serves as an educational tool for students, researchers, and enthusiasts to intuitively understand qubit behavior, gate effects, and the geometric representation of quantum states. It bridges mathematical concepts of quantum computing with interactive visualization.
